.. topic:: Overview

    Inspired by Ruby on Rails' migrations, SQLAlchemy Migrate provides a way to
    deal with database schema changes in SQLAlchemy_ projects.

    Migrate was started as part of `Google's Summer of Code`_ by Evan Rosson,
    mentored by Jonathan LaCour.

    The project was taken over by a small group of volunteers when Evan had no
    free time for the project. It is now hosted as a `Google Code project`_.
    During the hosting change the project was renamed to SQLAlchemy Migrate.

    Currently, sqlalchemy-migrate supports Python versions from 2.6 to 2.7.
    SQLAlchemy Migrate 0.7.2 supports SQLAlchemy 0.6.x and 0.7.x branches.

    Support for Python 2.4 and 2.5 as well as SQLAlchemy 0.5.x has been dropped
    after sqlalchemy-migrate 0.7.1.

.. warning::

    Version **0.6** broke backward compatibility, please read :ref:`changelog
    <backwards-06>` for more info.
