Development
-----------

Migrate's Mercurial_ repository is located at `Google Code`_.

To get the latest trunk::

 $ hg clone http://sqlalchemy-migrate.googlecode.com/hg/

Patches should be submitted to the `issue tracker`_. You are free to create
your own clone to provide your patches. We are open to pull requests in our
`issue tracker`_.

If you want to work on sqlalchemy-migrate you might want to use a `virtualenv`.

To run the included test suite you have to copy :file:`test_db.cfg.tmpl` to
:file:`test_db.cfg` and put SQLAlchemy database URLs valid for your environment
into that file. We use `nose`_ for our tests and include a test requirements
file for pip. You might use the following commands to install the test
requirements and run the tests::

 $ pip install -r test-req.pip
 $ python setup.py develop
 $ python setup.py nosetests

If you are curious about status changes of sqlalchemy-migrate's issues you
might want to subscribe to `sqlalchemy-migrate-issues`_.

We use a `Jenkins CI`_ continuous integration tool installation to
help us run tests on most of the databases that migrate supports.
