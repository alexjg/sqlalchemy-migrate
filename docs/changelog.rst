0.6 (11.07.2010)
---------------------------

.. _backwards-06:

.. warning:: **Backward incompatible changes**:

    - :py:func:`migrate.versioning.api.test` and schema comparison functions
      now all accept `url` as first parameter and `repository` as second.
    - python upgrade/downgrade scripts do not import `migrate_engine`
      magically, but recieve engine as the only parameter to function (eg.
      ``def upgrade(migrate_engine):``)
    - :py:meth:`Column.alter <migrate.changeset.schema.ChangesetColumn.alter>`
      does not accept `current_name` anymore, it extracts name from the old
      column.

Features
**************

- added support for :ref:`firebird <firebird-d>`
- added option to define custom templates through option ``--templates_path``
  and ``--templates_theme``,
  read more in :ref:`tutorial section <custom-templates>`
- use Python logging for output, can be shut down by passing
  ``--disable_logging`` to :py:func:`migrate.versioning.shell.main`
- deprecated `alter_column` comparing of columns. Just use explicit parameter
  change.
- added support for SQLAlchemy 0.6.x by Michael Bayer
- Constraint classes have `cascade=True` keyword argument to issue ``DROP
  CASCADE`` where supported
- added :py:class:`~migrate.changeset.constraint.UniqueConstraint`/
  :py:class:`~migrate.changeset.constraint.CheckConstraint` and corresponding
  create/drop methods
- API `url` parameter can also be an :py:class:`Engine` instance (this usage is
  discouraged though sometimes necessary)
- code coverage is up to 80% with more than 100 tests
- alter, create, drop column / rename table / rename index constructs now
  accept `alter_metadata` parameter. If True, it will modify Column/Table
  objects according to changes. Otherwise, everything will be untouched.
- added `populate_default` bool argument to :py:meth:`Column.create
  <migrate.changeset.schema.ChangesetColumn.create>` which issues corresponding
  UPDATE statements to set defaults after column creation
- :py:meth:`Column.create <migrate.changeset.schema.ChangesetColumn.create>`
  accepts `primary_key_name`, `unique_name` and `index_name` as string value
  which is used as contraint name when adding a column

Fixed bugs
*****************

- :term:`ORM` methods now accept `connection` parameter commonly used for
  transactions
- `server_defaults` passed to :py:meth:`Column.create
  <migrate.changeset.schema.ChangesetColumn.create>` are now issued correctly
- use SQLAlchemy quoting system to avoid name conflicts (#32)
- complete refactoring of :py:class:`~migrate.changeset.schema.ColumnDelta`
  (#23)
- partial refactoring of :py:mod:`migrate.changeset` package
- fixed bug when :py:meth:`Column.alter
  <migrate.changeset.schema.ChangesetColumn.alter>`\(server_default='string')
  was not properly set
- constraints passed to :py:meth:`Column.create
  <migrate.changeset.schema.ChangesetColumn.create>` are correctly interpreted
  (``ALTER TABLE ADD CONSTRAINT`` is issued after ``ATLER TABLE ADD COLUMN``)
- script names don't break with dot in the name
