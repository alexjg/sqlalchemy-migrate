- better SQL scripts support (testing, source viewing)

make_update_script_for_model:
- calculated differences between models are actually differences between metas
- columns are not compared?
- even if two "models" are equal, it doesn't yield so

- controlledschema.drop() drops whole migrate table, maybe there are some other repositories bound to it!

- required_dbs tests

- dot instead of semicolumn in dotted module name should have better deprecation warning
- change "model" in "metadata" for all highlevel api stuff

- serializers (json, yaml, etc)
